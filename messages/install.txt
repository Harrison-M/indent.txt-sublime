Hey, thank you for installing Indent.txt!
Let's learn how to use it.
All you have to do...
    Is create an indented hierarchy
    Of your notes
    In a list
    And Indent.txt will turn it into a nice HTML file
        With a ul hierarchy based on indent levels
        *And simple
        **formatting
It's great for:
    Note-taking
    Outlining
Try it now!
    Bring up the command menu (Ctrl-Shift-P)
    Find "Indent.txt: Parse"
        If you've never used the command menu before: it'll come up if you start typing it
    Run the command
        You can also highlight a section of the page, and Indent.txt will only parse that portion.
